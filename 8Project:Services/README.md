In this project, we will create your own Ross service interface.
For this project, we will make two nodes one node which acts like a client, which sends a request
of an angle to a robot to turn a camera and another node which takes in the request and sends back a
response, which will be an image the robot takes after moving the camera to the angle specified.
Now, since we do not have a real robot, we're just going to have some pre taken images which are named by an angle and return one of these images
based on the request.
