In the previous project,  we created two nodes, one which publishes the RPM of our robot and another 
which publishes the calculated speed of our robot based on that RPM value and our robots wheel radius. 
So now we to create a launch file so that with one command we can configure our parameter such 
as the RPM value for the RPM publisher node and a wheel radius parameter for our speed calculator node. 
When launching them, then we want to be able to see the speed topic being published to the screen.
