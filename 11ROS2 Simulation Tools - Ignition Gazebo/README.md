 First we are install the Ross ignition package and this Ros distro flag will just resolve to humble.

 </p>

 we can find a common example tutorial showcasing ignition gazebo at the following page.
**https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Advanced/Simulators/Gazebo/Gazebo.html** \
So here it has a test world which we can run called Visualize Light R, which will open up this little
world here with a small robot and a play structure environment.

opens up the gazebo simulation.
If using the virtual machine like VMware, there have been reported issues of the render not
properly displaying.

And one of the ways to fix this issue is to use an older version of the rendering engine like so

let's just go ahead and move on to some of the other features that Ignition Bridge has to offer.
let's try a different example such as the camera sensor example.
